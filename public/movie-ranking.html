    The best movie there is in terms of<br />
    1. Real spirituality<br />
    2. Closeness to Bharatiya Culture<br />

<h3>2. HanuMan</h3>
<p>
    Even though it mixes truth with superheroism<br />
    1. Still makes us think of Lord Hanuman<br />
    2. Still based in Bharatiya culture<br />
    3. Has the Hanuman chalisa and a great animation of Lord Hanuman<br />

    One downside is the disrespect of saints.  Which is quite a substantial downside.<br />
